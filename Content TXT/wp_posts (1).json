{"ID":"542","post_title":"Proper Driving Practices","post_type":"post","post_content":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/RvBOPJQgkdU?si=BsHLqkrPPj4QI_js\r\n<h1>Proper Driving Practices<\/h1>\r\nIn a world where transportation plays an integral role in our daily lives, we would like to offer some advice on practicing proper and defensive driving. In this video, we'll cover the basics, including defensive driving, avoiding distractions while driving, and tips for sharing the road with smaller vehicles and motorcycles. As a driver, we suggest that you stay alert and focused.\r\n\r\nDistracted driving is any activity that diverts attention from driving—anything that takes your attention away from the task of safe driving. So, as a driver, we recommend that you refrain from any form of distracted driving. If you find yourself in need of using the phone while on the road, please remember to adhere to the FMCSA guidelines and park in a safe area. Another aspect of proper driving is being aware and mindful of smaller vehicles and motorcycles on the road. Some tips on sharing the road with motorcycles and smaller vehicles are: use turn signals and flashers to indicate your intention, be extra cautious when passing, and watch for turning vehicles, as well as keeping a watchful eye on your mirrors to check for blind spots.\r\n\r\nBefore changing lanes or turning, remember to take a second look at left turns and try to be aware of what’s going on around you at all times. Make safety your priority. Stay alert, stay sharp. Drive smarts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div id=\"snippet\" class=\"style-scope ytd-text-inline-expander\"><\/div>\r\n<div class=\"style-scope ytd-watch-metadata\">\r\n<div id=\"items\" class=\"style-scope ytd-structured-description-content-renderer\">\r\n<div id=\"header\" class=\"style-scope ytd-video-description-transcript-section-renderer\"><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>","post_date":"2023-05-31 14:05:07"},
{"ID":"545","post_title":"Blind Spots and Hours of Operation","post_type":"post","post_content":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/XjCl-BqlYn8?si=ZbphhTIR2jtEvkxA\r\n<h1 class=\"style-scope ytd-watch-metadata\">Blind Spots and Hours of Operation<\/h1>\r\nStagecoach believes in prioritizing safety. We appreciate your role in promoting a proper driving experience for yourself, your truck, and the numerous fellow drivers sharing the road. Here are some suggestions: First, everything starts with you. We want you to be rested, alert, and focused for every trip. Please understand the importance of HOS (Hours of Service) and follow all guidelines for proper sleep time, resting, and resets.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to be aware of is blind spots. I know what you're thinking: 'How can another driver not see me about to change lanes?' Expect the possibility of other drivers being distracted while on the road. For example, you turn on your left turn signal, and the car in your rearview mirror not only ignores your signal but actually speeds up to prevent you from entering the left lane.\r\n\r\nBe patient. At some point, a polite driver will follow the law and let you change lanes. Always be aware of your blind spots and assume that there will always be a smaller vehicle there. Lean forward, look at the hood—it's not only a great way to stretch, but it can help in preventing changing lanes into another vehicle. Give yourself ample following distance and practice proper driving, and as always, stay sharp. Drive smarts.","post_date":"2023-07-05 14:11:19"},

Here are some pointers: Your truck lights should always be on; both sides of your equipment should have reflective tape, also known as Conspicuity tape. Remember to conduct pre- and post-trip inspections of your equipment, and contact dispatch if your truck has any kind of mechanical issue. They will address the matter and help you get back on the road as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe monsoon is quickly approaching, which means stronger thundershowers with the threat of heavy rain. Check the weather forecast before every trip and be prepared if weather conditions change suddenly. Storms and thundershowers may reduce visibility on the roadway. If you can no longer see the road in front of you, you may not be able to see a stopped car either. It is better to find a safe haven off the roadway and let the storm pass.\r\n\r\nStagecoach is always there to support you in making proper driving decisions when weather conditions change. As always, stay sharp. Drive smart.","post_date":"2023-08-04 14:14:26"},

During this informative video, we will explore the intricacies of cargo theft, its culprits, and, most crucially, effective strategies tailored to enhance the security of our goods during transit.\r\n\r\nLet's begin by explaining the scope of cargo theft's impact. Did you know that theft stands as the second most prevalent cause of motor truck cargo losses? According to the FBI, cargo theft has emerged as a pressing concern, resulting in substantial financial ramifications reaching into the billions.\r\n\r\nAs an integral part of this organization, you can help mitigate or assist in the prevention of cargo theft. Cargo theft is a multi-faceted issue that merits examination. All cargo is susceptible to the actions of opportunistic thieves and intricately organized criminal networks alike. Picture an unattended truck and trailer; they become a prime target for opportunists seeking swift gains. These individuals exploit moments of vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNow, let's delve into the characteristics that render cargo attractive to thieves. High-value goods, particularly those challenging to trace and easily marketable, are of prime interest to these thieves. We are here today to equip you with practical tools to enhance cargo security. Here are some strategies:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><strong>Enhanced Access Control<\/strong>: Use appropriate methods and equipment to establish effective barriers against unauthorized access. Remember, wheels don't prevent a break-in. Always use a padlock when possible; back the trailer up to fencing or a building to make it harder for thieves to open the doors and unload the cargo.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Strengthen Door Security<\/strong>: Verify that your equipment's doors close and latch properly.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Strategic Rest Stops<\/strong>: Whenever a stopover is necessary, opt for a well-lit, fenced area. These locations serve as visual deterrents and minimize vulnerabilities during stops.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Never discuss the contents of your load with other individuals<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Do not disconnect the trailer from the power unit unless authorized to do so by the company<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nIn conclusion, remember that safeguarding cargo is a collective endeavor. Stagecoach Cartage and Distribution, its diligent drivers, and law enforcement agencies stand united against cargo theft. By embracing these strategies, we aren't solely protecting cargo; we are securing the backbone of our operations. Your commitment is instrumental in steering us toward a future where cargo theft is a challenge of the past.","post_date":"2023-09-27 14:23:51"},
{"ID":"561","post_title":"Seatbelts and High-Visibility Vests","post_type":"post","post_content":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/JZSVmrSJ-xY?si=nPHZQ_rNwwo9qoPf\r\n<h1 class=\"style-scope ytd-watch-metadata\">Seatbelts and High-Visibility Vests<\/h1>\r\nWelcome to Stagecoach Cartage and Distribution, where we prioritize responsible practices on the road. Today, we'll discuss guidelines that promote your well-being and help you stay alert while driving. So, let's set off on a journey toward conscientious trucking.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, let's address the use of seat belts. It's a fundamental habit that enhances your security during your journey. So, before you start your engine, make sure you fasten your seat belt. Next, consider the value of visibility when you're outside your truck, especially in bustling environments or low-light conditions. Wearing a high-visibility vest can be a game-changer. These vests make you easily noticeable when you're out of your truck. Put on that vest; it's a small action with substantial benefits.\r\n\r\nYour choice of footwear plays a role in maintaining stability and comfort during your job. Opt for shoes or boots with adequate support and slip-resistant soles. This decision can aid with balance as well as when getting in and out of your cab. When it comes to entering and exiting your truck, adopt the practice of using three points of contact. This means having at least three body parts in contact with the truck at all times. This technique boosts stability and minimizes the risks of falls or mishaps.\r\n\r\nLastly, let's talk about maintaining a focused and distraction-free environment in your cab. By minimizing distractions, you enhance your ability to be aware of your surroundings on the road. Your undivided attention is a good tool against unexpected situations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let's encourage responsible practices and a secure and effective journey. Buckle up, put on your high visibility vest, choose suitable footwear, use three points of contact, and keep your cab environment distraction-free to stay alert. By adhering to these principles, you not only ensure your own well-being but also contribute to a safer road environment for everyone.\r\n\r\nThank you for your dedication to responsible trucking and for being a part of the Stage Coach Cartage and Distribution family. Wishing you smooth and aware travels as we continue our journey together toward a responsible trucking experience. Stay sharp and drive safe.","post_date":"2023-09-30 14:34:28"},
{"ID":"563","post_title":"Winter Driving Advice","post_type":"post","post_content":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/VPdoqQCflAc?si=L4NXSQ2qrd3roR43\r\n<h1 class=\"style-scope ytd-watch-metadata\">Winter Driving Advice<\/h1>\r\nDuring the winter months, road conditions can be quite different from those conditions during the summer. We are here to offer some safe winter practices that CDL holders nationwide should keep in mind. As a driver, it is good to take into consideration that trips over icy roads will take longer than driving the same distance under good road and weather conditions. Therefore, you should always plan your trip accordingly. Plan to leave earlier for your trip to give yourself extra time for delays that you might encounter.\r\n\r\nStart gently at the beginning of the trip, taking your time and making sure to get a good feel for the road. That way, you're never in a rush. Try to avoid using your engine brakes whenever possible; it is best not to use them at all in winter weather. Be sure to check your mirrors often and watch the trailer when you brake. This will let you know that the trailer is not coming out of line or swinging to one side or another.\r\n\r\nWhile driving, adjust your speed to the conditions so that you are always driving at a safe speed. Watch far enough ahead so that you can react to the traffic conditions accordingly, and try not to pass other vehicles unless you have to. Maintain a longer following distance; your only way out may be directly in front of you.\r\n\r\nAs a rule of thumb, remember that it can take three times the distance to stop compared to dry roads. Make sure that you are pulling your trailer and that the trailer is not pushing you. Keep in mind that changing lanes while pulling the trailer may cause a jackknife. Therefore, it is important to take curves and turns at a slower speed and always try to brake while the tractor and trailer are straight in line with each other.\r\n\r\nSomething to keep in the back of your mind is to brake before the curves or turns, not during, and remember if you begin to see your lights in the mirror at night, it may mean that your trailer is jackknifing.\r\n\r\nIf traffic ahead looks congested, slow down and wait for traffic to thin out. That way, you're not stuck in a pack or in a possible difficult situation. It is always a good idea to avoid driving beside other vehicles so that you have room to maneuver in case an emergency action needs to be taken.\r\n\r\nRemember that as the weather starts warming up, ice will melt and become slippery. Be alert of this and slow down if necessary. Be sure to slow down gradually, not rapidly.\r\n\r\nBe sure to always follow the five rules of safe winter driving: the number one cause of accidents during winter months is driving at a speed that is too fast for the conditions. First, slow down on ice and snow, keeping in mind that traction can be lost with either sudden deceleration or excessive acceleration.\r\n\r\nAs a driver, remember to drive slow enough that you are always able to pull the trailer because if you're not pulling the trailer, it is pushing you. The second rule of safe winter driving is to increase your following distance. The less following distance you allow, the less reaction time you have. Make sure to maintain a minimum of 14 to 15 seconds following distance on wet roads.\r\n\r\nThird, stay alert to the possible variables that can be experienced during winter weather driving conditions and always try to anticipate the unexpected. The fourth rule is to practice smooth and easy driving techniques by not making rough or sudden changes in direction or momentum. The smoother a driver shifts, brakes, turns, accelerates, and decelerates, the less chance the truck has to lose traction.\r\n\r\nFinally, conduct daily inspections and report any defect for maintenance or repair. Always complete your driver vehicle inspection report (DVIR) every day for every problem or defective item found. Safety, road conditions, delivery schedules, and traffic will always be on the top of your mind, but we must not forget the normal day-to-day things like walking, maneuvering around fuel islands, rest areas, or even getting in or out of your truck will also hold potential dangers. Snow or ice will increase the opportunity for slipping, tripping, or falling. Proper gear or footwear designed for these conditions will help prevent slips and falls.\r\n\r\nWalking or climbing methods could help you as well. Always use three points of contact when entering or exiting a vehicle. When walking in dark parking lots, make sure you have a flashlight to help you identify obstacles. Keep in mind that when we walk, our leg's ability to support our weight is split mid-stride. To walk on ice, keeping your center of gravity over your front leg is a must.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended you make some room in the cab for some items that will help you out during the winter season, such as an extra set of warm clothes and blankets, winter shoes that have good traction, a pair of waterproof gloves, and a heavy reflective coat are a must during the winter season. Non-perishables, water, and a can opener should always be brought along, as well as a first aid kit, a snow broom for windows, mirrors, or steps, a small shovel, jumper cables, and a headlamp that can keep your hands free are good to have on your checklist.\r\n\r\nWorking the trailer crank is an everyday thing when on slick surfaces; it helps to have a small bag of kitty litter to put on the ground to help you create a surface that will give you traction. Make sure you communicate with your manager the possible change in your time to arrive at the customer. With that, we understand that there may be situations that could require chains, so we would like to remind you of the steps to chaining up so that you're prepared for when you need them.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to remove the chains from the chain box or hanger. Remember to use your legs, not your back, when lifting. Second, spread the chain out on the ground in front of or behind the wheel you are chaining. Make sure that the cams are on the street side of the wheel when laying out the chains. Third, straighten the chains. A good tip for you is that when placing the chain onto the tire, it is much easier to pull the chains up onto the tire than it is trying to flip them over the tire. You'll have less chance of tangling the chains.\r\n\r\nThe fourth step is to carefully move your truck forward just enough to roll onto the chains but not so much that the other end of the chains falls off the tires. Next, hook the rail ends and use the cam tool to tighten each cam. You should finish the job with at least two bungee cords. Use these to secure the loose ends of the rails; just be sure to check that the bungee hooks face away from the tire. A good idea is to stop within the first 2 to 5 miles to check on the chains and make any adjustments if needed.\r\n\r\nWe hope that all this information helps you during the winter season. Thank you for watching. Stay sharp and drive safe.","post_date":"2023-10-30 14:38:45"},
{"ID":"565","post_title":"Responsible Driving Practices","post_type":"post","post_content":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/1V7dFuHy4JQ?si=hQ8Xz3oGdpnGFBon\r\n<h1 class=\"style-scope ytd-watch-metadata\">Responsible Driving Practices<\/h1>\r\nWelcome to Stagecoach Cartage and Distribution, your partner in responsible driving practices. Today, we'll delve into factors that come into play during the fall season when we anticipate changes in wildlife behavior. We'll also discuss the significance of not swerving when encountering animals on the road, the essential use of headlights, adjusting your speed in accordance with road conditions, as well as remaining mindful of road signs. So let's embark on a journey toward more informed and conscientious trucking.\r\n\r\nAs we enter this season, we should recognize that deer and other wildlife may be migrating. This means there's a higher likelihood of encountering animals on the road. When faced with such situations, it's recommended not to swerve your truck. Instead, it's often safer to slow your speed, maintain your course, and if necessary, make the choice to hit the animal. Another key aspect of responsible driving is the constant use of headlights. Your headlights play a role in enhancing visibility during low light conditions. Headlights can make your truck more visible to others and help you spot animals or road hazards in advance. Remember, visibility aids in avoiding incidents.\r\n\r\nIn addition to using your headlights, adjusting your speed according to the prevailing road conditions is recommended. In this season, the presence of wildlife and possible inclement weather may necessitate a slower pace. Slowing down gives you more time to react to unexpected situations. Be cautious on curves near water sources or in areas known for wildlife crossings.\r\n\r\nNow, let's discuss road signs. Road signs are designed to convey information about upcoming road conditions, speed limits, and potential hazards. Be vigilant and follow the guidance provided by road signs.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as this season unfolds with the possibility of increased wildlife activity, let's practice responsible driving. Slow your speed in known wildlife areas; do not swerve to avoid animals on the road. Instead, hit the animal. Utilize your headlights to enhance visibility and reduce your speed according to road conditions. Lastly, stay aware of and adhere to road signs as they offer road safety information.\r\n\r\nThank you for your commitment to responsible trucking and for being a part of the Stagecoach Cartage and Distribution family. Safe travels, and let's continue to journey together toward a season of informed and conscientious trucking. As always, stay sharp and drive safely.","post_date":"2024-01-19 14:43:11"},
