## Tools for Creation

You can create this image using:
- Adobe Photoshop
- Figma
- Canva
- GIMP (free alternative)

## Testing

After creating the image:
1. Test how it appears when shared on various social platforms
2. Verify the image loads correctly on the website
3. Check that the image is properly referenced in the metadata

## Temporary Solution

Until a proper OpenGraph image is created, the website will use a default image or fall back to the logo. However, a custom-designed OpenGraph image will significantly improve social sharing appearance and click-through rates.
